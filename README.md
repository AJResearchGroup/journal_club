## FAQ

### Is attending obligatory?

Yes. 

That means that every week you can look forward to meet:

 * Åsa
 * Daniel
 * ?Emma
 * Fatemeh
 * Hadrien
 * Julia
 * Mathias
 * Richel
 * Therese
 * Torgny
 * Valeria
 * Weronica

Others are welcome to join as well :-)

Of course, sometimes that are good reasons to be absent.
In that case, send an email to Åsa.

### Is presenting a paper obligatory?

Yes, starting week 33, which is August 19th 2021.

The schedule simply rotates over all people within our group.

That means that every week you can look forward to presentations from:

 * Mathias
 * Richel
 * Valeria
 * Torgny
 * Weronica
 * Åsa
 * Daniel
 * Fatemeh
 * Hadrien
 * Julia
 * Therese
 * ?Emma

This order has evolved from a nice alphabetical one, to its present state :-)

### As a presenter, how do I structure the time between presentation and discussion?

You, as a presenter, are boss here.

A goal of the journal club is to read more papers and discuss these,
so at least 1 minute of discussion is the bare minimum :-)

### I want to present a paper earlier, is that OK?

Definitely! Share this with Richel and he will move you to your
preferred spot in the schedule.

### I want to present a paper at another time, is that OK?

Definitely! Ideally, find someone to swap with and let Richel know.
Else, let Richel know.

### How much time am I expected to spend reading the paper?

Minimally 30 mins.

This ensures we can have a proper discussion about the paper.

### How are papers selected?

A paper should be relevant to at least 1 other group member.

If you are unsure, you can ask Åsa.

### How do I let Richel know?

 * Create a Pull Request
 * Create an Issue
 * Email

### What do you always paste in the chat room at the start of a meeting?

```
9:00 Introduce speaker, ask questions during talk yes/no, shout or raise hand?
9:55 No more questions.
9:58 Announce next week's speaker
9:59 Close meeting.
```
